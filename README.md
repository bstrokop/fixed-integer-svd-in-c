# fixed-integer-svd-in-c
Well, I am a jobless Moscow scientist and programmer.Trough all my life was doing macromolecular crystallography and programming (mainly in Fortran 77/90). I an interested in linear algebra, graphs, fast Fourier transform. I know perl, javascript, bash shell. Do some scripting in Julia and Python.

fixed integer svd in c
The idea behind this project is to have a code written in C language to perform SVD decomposition of small 4x4 matrices.
Instead of a floating point, we need to write a code which can do this for FIXED integer floating point.
